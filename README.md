***Notice***: **eComInit is not yet ready for use** - please do not use it in
production until version 1.0 is published on the Releases page. In the
meantime, you may discuss it on IRC: see *#ecomcloud* on Freenode.

*eComCloud Object Solutions™* **eComInit**™ is a
cloud-friendly init system and resource manager. Its merits include:
 * *Cross-platform OS support*, including full support for GNU/Linux®, HP-UX®,
 and several other platforms, with an emphasis on FreeBSD®.
 * A *robust and sophisticated modular architecture*, designed in line with
 the *Four Motives* of eComCloud: Adaptable, Modular, Reliable, Informative.
 * A *lightweight JASON-RPC-based communications interface* compliant with
 all relevant standards.
 * The flexible *Resource Object Model*, a means by which eComInit may track the
  state of resources which may not fit a process-based availability semantic.

Cloud-enable your systems by adopting our modern and scalable service
management solution.
